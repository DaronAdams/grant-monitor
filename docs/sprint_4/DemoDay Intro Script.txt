Hello, we are Daron and Sons WebDev Company! That’s Daron, and we are his sons: I’m Chase, that’s Ken, and Alex. We were asked by the Computer Science Administration Faculty to help in developing a new and more efficient way to handle academic grant ingestion. The appeal? A university like ours gets a significant amount of its funding from research grants, which means that as an R1 University we have a LOT of grants to parse through. With a myriad of documents, all containing distinct, crucial financial and personal information, it was immediately apparent that there was huge room for improvement on the existing system.
The benefit of building a project like this from the ground up was that we had total control of the tech stack, what we wanted to use for the front and backend. Total creative freedom so long as it did everything it needed to do. What you can see here is the result of our combined efforts. Please feel free to test it out yourself.
